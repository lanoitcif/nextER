# Claude & Gemini API Key Management Review

This document summarizes the analysis performed by the assistant on the testing suite, API key management, and admin tools.

## Summary
- AES‑256‑GCM encryption is used for user API keys.
- Environment variables store encryption secrets and provider owner keys.
- `lib/crypto.ts` validates secret length and encrypts keys with AES‑256‑GCM.
- API routes never return plaintext keys; only encrypted tokens are stored.
- Admin API allows assigning encrypted keys to users and logs the action.
- Jest tests mock Supabase to validate authentication error responses.

## Potential Improvements
### Testing Suite
- Expand coverage to include successful flows and error handling.
- Add integration tests for admin endpoints and React components.

### API Key Management
- Reduce verbose logging in production with log levels.
- Document procedures for rotating `USER_API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_SECRET`.

### Admin Tools
- Add audit logs and bulk revocation features.
- Ensure role-based checks for admin pages and test them.

## Testing
- `npm test` currently passes all Jest suites (13 tests).
