# Development Log

## Session Summaries

### July 17, 2025: Alt-Tab State Reset Fix & Documentation Consolidation
- **Alt-Tab State Reset Issue**: Resolved analysis types dropdown resetting on window focus changes
- **Root Cause**: Dashboard page `useEffect` with `[user, isVisible]` dependency causing unnecessary re-renders
- **Solution**: Removed `isVisible` dependency from dashboard page useEffect
- **Documentation Consolidation**: Successfully reduced documentation from 25 to 10 files using management best practices
- **Database Data Consistency**: Ensured all records have proper field values, fixed general_analysis company type
- **Deployment**: All fixes deployed to production (commits 1dad503, 16e1368)

### July 15, 2025: Complete Frontend Debugging & Fixes
- **Company Search System**: Resolved authentication and RLS policy issues.
- **Company Types Dropdown**: Fixed duplicate state declarations and artificial timeouts.
- **Dropdown Visibility Issue**: Added explicit `setShowDropdown(true)` for exact matches.
- **Browser Extension Interference**: Identified and mitigated issues caused by browser extensions.
- **Company Types Query Timeout**: Removed `Promise.race` timeout wrapper and optimized the query.
- **TypeScript Compilation**: Fixed all compilation errors.

### January 17, 2025: Dropdown Selection Issue
- **Initial Problem**: Dropdown selection appeared to work but analysis type dropdown never appeared.
- **Root Cause**: Race condition in `onChange` handler resetting state during database queries.
- **Solution**: Separated typing state from selection state.
- **Result**: End-to-end workflow now functional in production.

## Technical Milestones and Breakthroughs
- **TRIPOD Framework Validation**: The multi-AI collaboration framework proved effective for complex technical issues.
- **Systematic Debugging**: The use of a systematic debugging methodology led to the successful resolution of several complex issues.
- **Production-Only Workflow**: The team successfully adopted a production-only development workflow, enabling rapid iteration and debugging.

## Problem Resolution Case Studies

### Alt-Tab State Reset Issue (July 17, 2025)
- **Problem**: Analysis types dropdown was resetting to "Select a company first..." after alt-tabbing away and back
- **Investigation**: Database queries were succeeding but state was being reset due to visibility changes
- **Root Cause**: Dashboard page `useEffect` with `[user, isVisible]` dependency causing React re-renders
- **Resolution**: Removed `isVisible` dependency from dashboard page useEffect, matching fix already applied to analyze page
- **Impact**: Users can now alt-tab without losing their analysis type selection

### Dropdown Selection Issue (January 17, 2025)
- **Problem**: A persistent issue with the company dropdown selection.
- **Investigation**: The team used a systematic debugging approach, including adding debugger statements, enhanced logging, and verifying click handler attachment.
- **Resolution**: The root cause was identified as a race condition in the `onChange` handler, and the issue was resolved by separating the typing state from the selection state.

## Collaboration Success Stories
The resolution of the dropdown selection issue was a major success for the TRIPOD collaboration framework. The use of multiple AI perspectives, combined with a systematic debugging approach, allowed the team to identify and resolve a complex issue that had previously resisted multiple fixing attempts.

## Lessons Learned and Best Practices
- **React State Management**: Aggressive `onChange` handlers can create race conditions.
- **Debugging Strategy**: Progressive isolation is more effective than trial-and-error.
- **Multi-AI Collaboration**: Different perspectives provide comprehensive analysis.
- **State Management**: Race conditions can masquerade as database issues.
- **Symptom vs. Cause**: Database "hanging" was actually state interference.
- **Visibility Dependencies**: useEffect dependencies on `isVisible` can cause unexpected re-renders.
- **Alt-Tab Behavior**: Window focus changes can trigger React effects and reset application state.
- **Documentation Management**: Consolidating documentation reduces maintenance overhead and improves discoverability.
- **Database Consistency**: Regular data consistency checks prevent production issues.
