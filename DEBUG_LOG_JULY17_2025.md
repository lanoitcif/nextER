# Dropdown Persistence Issue - July 17, 2025

## User Report

The user reported that the dropdown fails to populate after alt-tabbing away from the page:

```
THe drop down file still isn't working. Alt-tabbing is still breaking some kind of state and sync.
The drop down after selecting the company iosn't populating. Company type IDs to fetch: (3) ['hospitality_reit', 'earnings_analyst', 'general_analysis']
```

## Assistant Response

The assistant explained that `fetchCompanyTypes` in `app/dashboard/analyze/page.tsx` should log the query timing and results. If no `COMPLETED company types query` message appears, the query may be hanging.

Key points from the guidance:

- Check the Supabase session with `supabase.auth.getSession()` before querying.
- Ensure browser extensions or network blockers are not interfering.
- Verify Row Level Security policies allow reading from `company_types`.
- If all else looks correct, run the SQL query directly in Supabase to confirm data is returned.

This summary documents the unresolved dropdown issue so Claude and Gemini can continue debugging.
