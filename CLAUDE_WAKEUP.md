# CLAUDE_WAKEUP.md - Session Resume Guide

## Last Session Summary (July 17, 2025)

### What We Discovered
1. **Found Codex's Branch** ✅
   - Branch: `codex/fix-company-search-and-transcript-submission-issues`
   - Contains multiple changes including API key functionality updates

2. **Identified API Key Storage Issue** ✅
   - Frontend expects `preferred_model` field for each API key
   - Database table `user_api_keys` is missing this column
   - Backend API routes don't handle preferred_model storage/retrieval
   - Validation schema allows it but it's not implemented end-to-end

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Frontend (`/app/dashboard/api-keys/page.tsx`) sends preferredModel in POST
   - Backend (`/app/api/user-api-keys/route.ts`) receives but doesn't store it
   - Database schema lacks `preferred_model` column
   - GET endpoint doesn't retrieve preferred_model

### ✅ COMPLETED FIXES (July 17, 2025)

#### 1. **Default Analyst Auto-Selection** ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: Primary analyst wasn't populating after company selection
**Root Cause**: React state timing issues in `fetchCompanyTypes` function
**Solution Implemented**:
- Added setTimeout for proper state update timing
- Implemented backup useEffect for redundant auto-selection
- Enhanced state cleanup during company transitions
- Added visual indicators for auto-selected analysts

**Files Modified**:
- `app/dashboard/analyze/page.tsx` (lines 187-195, 274-290, 311-324, 755-795)

**Verification**:
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ PASSED
- Auto-selection logic: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Visual feedback: ✅ ADDED
- State management: ✅ IMPROVED

#### 2. **Enhanced User Experience** ✅ COMPLETED
- Added "(Auto-selected)" indicator when primary analyst is chosen
- Added "(Primary)" labels in dropdown for clarity
- Improved console logging for debugging
- Enhanced state transitions between companies

### Previous Session Context
- Company selection workflow: ✅ FULLY WORKING
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ FIXED
- Analyst auto-selection: ✅ RESOLVED
- Ready for end-to-end LLM analysis testing

### Remaining Tasks
1. **Database Migration** (if API key preferred_model still needed)
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE public.user_api_keys 
   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS preferred_model TEXT;
   ```

2. **Update API Routes** (if needed for preferred model storage)
3. **End-to-End Analysis Testing** (next priority)
