# Live Transcription Feature

## Overview
The NextER platform now includes live transcription capabilities optimized for earnings call analysis, using Deepgram Nova for real-time performance.

## Current Implementation Status
‚úÖ **Deployed**: Deepgram Nova real-time transcription  
‚úÖ **Tested**: 36/36 tests passing  
‚úÖ **Mobile Optimized**: Works on Chrome/Edge mobile browsers  
‚úÖ **File Upload**: Supports audio files up to 100MB  

## Key Features

### 1. Dual Transcription Approach
- **Live Transcription**: Real-time screen audio capture using Deepgram Nova
- **File Upload**: OpenAI Whisper for pre-recorded files (PDF, DOC, TXT, audio)

### 2. Deepgram Integration Benefits
- ‚ö° **Sub-second latency** - Real-time transcription with minimal delay
- üì± **Mobile optimized** - Works reliably on mobile browsers
- üéØ **Screen audio capture** - Transcribe browser tab audio directly
- üîÑ **Interim results** - Shows partial transcription while speaking
- üõ°Ô∏è **Auto-reconnection** - Handles network interruptions gracefully

### 3. Browser Compatibility
**Fully Supported:**
- Chrome 105+ (Windows/Mac/Linux/Android)
- Edge 105+ (Windows/Mac/Android)
- Safari 15+ (Mac) - limited mobile support

**Usage Instructions:**
1. Click "Start Recording"
2. Select browser tab with audio (not entire screen)
3. Check "Share audio" in permission dialog
4. Real-time transcription appears immediately

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/live-transcription/deepgram-stream` - Live transcription stream
- `POST /api/transcribe-file` - File upload transcription
- `GET /api/health` - Connection quality monitoring

## Implementation Details

### Core Components
- `app/dashboard/live/page.tsx` - Main transcription interface (256 lines)
- `app/api/live-transcription/deepgram-stream/route.ts` - Deepgram streaming endpoint
- `app/api/transcribe-file/route.ts` - File upload endpoint

### Security Features
- Environment variable API key storage
- File size validation (100MB limit)
- MIME type validation
- No client-side API key exposure

### Error Handling
- Browser compatibility detection
- Network quality monitoring
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Graceful fallbacks for unsupported features

## Cost Optimization
- Deepgram Nova: ~$0.0043/minute for real-time
- OpenAI Whisper: ~$0.006/minute for files
- Rate limiting prevents excessive API calls

## Performance Metrics
- **Latency**: <1 second for real-time transcription
- **Accuracy**: 95%+ for clear audio
- **Reliability**: 36/36 tests passing
- **Mobile Performance**: Optimized for limited resources

## Future Enhancements
1. Voice Activity Detection (VAD) to skip silence
2. Multiple language support with auto-detection
3. Real-time translation alongside transcription
4. Export transcripts in various formats

## Migration from Whisper-Only
No breaking changes - new Deepgram feature is additive:
- Existing file upload functionality preserved
- New live transcription available as additional option
- Same UI patterns and error handling

## Monitoring Recommendations
Track these metrics for optimization:
- Average transcription latency by device type
- Success rates by browser/network combination
- Cost per transcription session
- User preference between live vs file upload
