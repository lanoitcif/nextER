# Incomplete Features Documentation

**Last Updated**: January 29, 2025

This document tracks features that were started but not completed, preserving the intent and technical details for potential future implementation.

## 1. QA-Only Analysis Capture System

**Branch**: `codex/plan-and-implement-qa-only-feature`  
**PR**: #23  
**Status**: Technically complete but missing configuration

### Feature Intent
Automatically extract and store structured Q&A data from earnings call transcripts when using "QA Only" analysis types.

### What Was Implemented
- ‚úÖ Database table: `earnings_qa` with proper schema
- ‚úÖ Parsing utility: `lib/utils/qa.ts` for markdown table extraction
- ‚úÖ API endpoint: `/api/earnings-qa` for querying Q&A data
- ‚úÖ Integration with main analysis flow
- ‚úÖ Unit tests for parsing functionality

### What's Missing
- ‚ùå No "QA Only" company types in database
- ‚ùå System prompts not deployed
- ‚ùå No UI for viewing captured Q&A data
- ‚ùå Merge conflicts with main branch

### Technical Details
The feature parses markdown tables with this structure:
```markdown
| Analyst (Firm) | Question Topic | Key Points | Quantitative Data | Management Response | Quarter | Year |
```

### Value Proposition
- Systematic capture of analyst questions
- Searchable database of earnings Q&A
- Trend analysis capabilities
- Competitive intelligence

### To Complete This Feature
1. Create QA-only versions of existing company types
2. Deploy the system prompts from `samples/QA only - company type prompts.json`
3. Resolve merge conflicts with main
4. Add UI for viewing Q&A data
5. Test end-to-end workflow

### Code References
- Database schema: `app/api/earnings-qa/route.ts`
- Parsing logic: `lib/utils/qa.ts`
- Tests: `lib/utils/__tests__/qa.test.ts`

## 2. Live Earnings Call Transcription

**Branch**: `codex/implement-live-transcription-for-earnings-calls`  
**PR**: #22  
**Status**: Functional but has critical security issues

### Feature Intent
Allow users to transcribe earnings calls in real-time by capturing audio from webcast URLs and using OpenAI's Whisper API.

### What Was Implemented
- ‚úÖ Live transcription dashboard page
- ‚úÖ WebSocket streaming for audio chunks
- ‚úÖ OpenAI Whisper integration
- ‚úÖ Real-time transcription display

### Critical Issues
- üî¥ **No authentication on WebSocket endpoints** - Anyone can use owner's API key
- üî¥ **Direct API key exposure** - Uses OWNER_OPENAI_API_KEY without permission checks
- üî¥ **No rate limiting** - Could drain API credits
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Browser limitations** - CORS prevents most webcast audio capture
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Non-standard WebSocket handling** - May fail in production

### Technical Details
- Frontend: `app/dashboard/live/page.tsx`
- WebSocket endpoint: `/api/live-transcription/stream`
- Uses browser's `HTMLMediaElement.captureStream()` API
- Streams audio chunks via WebSocket to backend

### Why It Was Not Merged
1. Security vulnerability allows unauthorized API usage
2. Technical implementation likely to fail with real webcasts
3. No cost tracking or user attribution
4. Incomplete integration with existing workflow

### To Salvage This Feature
Complete rewrite recommended:
1. Implement proper authentication on all endpoints
2. Use user's own API keys or implement cost attribution
3. Add rate limiting and usage tracking
4. Consider server-side audio capture instead of browser-based
5. Use proper WebSocket library (e.g., Socket.io)
6. Integrate with existing transcript analysis workflow
7. Add comprehensive error handling

### Alternative Approach
Instead of live transcription, consider:
- Upload recorded earnings calls
- Use existing file upload infrastructure
- Process audio files server-side
- More reliable and secure

## Decision Log

### January 29, 2025
- **QA-Only Feature**: Keep branch for potential future completion. The implementation is solid but needs configuration work.
- **Live Transcription**: Delete branch due to security vulnerabilities. The concept has merit but needs complete reimplementation.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Features need end-to-end testing** before considering them complete
2. **Security must be built in** from the start, not added later
3. **Browser limitations** should be researched before implementation
4. **Configuration and deployment** are part of feature completion
5. **UI components** should be developed alongside API features

**Note**: Both features have value but were not production-ready. This documentation preserves the technical work and lessons learned for future reference.
