## Priority 2: Architectural Decision Required 🤔

### Alternative: Deepgram Integration
**Branch**: `whisper-transcription-feature`  
**Status**: ⚠️ Needs Decision  
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Performance vs Feature Trade-off  

**Key Differences from Whisper Implementation**:
- ✅ **Faster Processing**: Sub-second latency vs 4-32s for Whisper
- ✅ **Better Mobile Support**: Optimized for mobile devices
- ❌ **External Dependency**: Requires Deepgram API subscription
- ❌ **Less Flexible**: Fewer customization options than Whisper
- ❌ **Additional Cost**: ~$0.0125/minute vs $0.006/minute for Whisper

**Decision Required**:
1. **Merge Whisper Implementation** (recommended) - Complete feature with proven testing
2. **Switch to Deepgram** - Faster but external dependency
3. **Implement Both** - User choice between speed and cost
4. **Hybrid Approach** - Deepgram for real-time, Whisper for quality

**Recommendation**: Merge Whisper implementation first, evaluate Deepgram as future enhancement

- Comprehensive test coverage
- Performance optimization initiatives

## Recommendations for Team Review

### 1. Immediate Actions (This Sprint)
- **MERGE** `feature/transcript-acceptance-and-qa-extraction` → `main`
- **FIX** Supabase security settings (1-day task)
- **INVESTIGATE** Android file upload issue

### 2. Architecture Decisions Required
- **System Prompt Management**: Approve 16-week implementation plan?
- **Transcription Strategy**: Whisper-only or Deepgram hybrid approach?
- **Technical Debt**: What percentage of sprint capacity for refactoring?

### 3. Resource Allocation Questions
- How many developers available for major feature work?
- What's the priority: new features vs. technical debt vs. bug fixes?
- Should System Prompt Management be next major feature or defer for stability?

### 4. Success Metrics
- Define targets for test coverage improvement
- Set performance benchmarks for RLS optimization
- Establish user satisfaction metrics for transcription features

## Next Steps

1. **Senior Developer Review**: Architecture decisions and resource allocation
2. **Team Planning Session**: Priority consensus and sprint planning
