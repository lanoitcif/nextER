# Branch Documentation Summary - July 2025

## Overview
This document summarizes the valuable documentation extracted from audit/review branches before their deletion.

## Documents Saved

### 1. RLS Performance Analysis (July 2025)
**File**: `docs/RLS_PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS_JULY_2025.md`
**Source**: `origin/codex/review-and-audit-feature-branches:rls_performance_analysis.md`
**Content**: Detailed analysis of the failed RLS performance optimization attempt on July 19, 2025
**Key Insights**:
- Documents a production outage caused by attempting to wrap `auth.uid()` in subqueries
- Provides lessons learned about Supabase-specific RLS behavior
- Includes alternative performance optimization strategies

### 2. Branch Merge Plan (July 2025)
**File**: `docs/BRANCH_MERGE_PLAN_JULY_2025.md`
**Source**: `origin/codex/review-and-prioritize-open-branches-for-merging:BRANCH_MERGE_PLAN.md`
**Content**: Comprehensive strategy for merging outstanding branches and resolving auth/RLS issues
**Key Insights**:
- Details critical security updates already applied locally
- Provides conflict analysis for each branch
- Includes API route update templates for cookie-based auth migration
- Contains a detailed 5-phase merge sequence with timeline

### 3. RLS Failed Optimization Script
**File**: `docs/RLS_FAILED_OPTIMIZATION_JULY_2025.md`
**Source**: `origin/codex/review-and-resolve-rls-warnings-from-supabase:fix_rls_performance.sql`
**Content**: The actual SQL script that caused the production outage
**Purpose**: Preserved as a reference of what NOT to do with Supabase RLS

### 4. RLS Rollback Script
**File**: `docs/RLS_ROLLBACK_SCRIPT.sql`
**Source**: `origin/codex/review-and-resolve-rls-warnings-from-supabase:rollback_rls_policies.sql`
**Content**: Emergency rollback script that restored service after the failed optimization
**Purpose**: Valuable reference for future RLS policy management

## Key Takeaways

### Security Issues Identified
1. **RLS was disabled on all public tables** - Critical vulnerability fixed locally
2. **Mixed authentication patterns** - Bearer tokens and cookies used inconsistently
3. **Custom JWT decoding** - Security bypass in extract-pdf route

### Branch Management Insights
1. Local changes include critical security fixes not yet pushed to origin
2. Multiple feature branches need auth pattern updates before merging
3. Older codex branches (6-7 days) likely superseded by recent changes

### Technical Lessons
1. Supabase RLS has specific behavior that differs from standard PostgreSQL
2. The `(SELECT auth.uid())` optimization pattern fails in Supabase
3. Always test RLS changes in development and prepare rollback scripts

## Action Items from Documentation
1. Push 5 local commits to origin/main immediately (critical security fixes)
2. Update 6 API routes from Bearer token to cookie-based auth
3. Review and merge feature branches with careful conflict resolution
4. Delete stale codex branches after extracting any useful content

## Notes
- The branch review/audit process revealed critical security vulnerabilities
- Documentation preservation ensures institutional knowledge is retained
- The merge plan provides a clear path forward for branch consolidation
