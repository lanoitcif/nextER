# RLS Performance Optimization Analysis

## Issue Summary
On July 19, 2025, we attempted to implement RLS performance optimization based on Supabase advisor recommendation. The optimization failed and was rolled back.

## Attempted Optimization
**Original Issue**: `auth.uid()` function re-evaluated for each row in RLS policies  
**Suggested Fix**: Wrap in subquery `(SELECT auth.uid())` to evaluate once per query  
**Expected Benefit**: Reduce query time from seconds to microseconds on large tables

## Implementation
Applied optimization to all RLS policies in:
- `user_profiles` table (7 policies)
- `user_api_keys` table (2 policies)  
- `usage_logs` table (2 policies)
- `system_settings` table (1 policy)

## Failure Analysis
**Symptoms**: 500 Internal Server Error on all affected endpoints
- `GET /rest/v1/user_profiles` - 500 error
- `GET /rest/v1/usage_logs` - 500 error
- Frontend unable to load user profile or usage data

**Root Cause**: The `(SELECT auth.uid())` subquery syntax appears incompatible with Supabase's RLS implementation or creates circular references in policy evaluation.

## Resolution
- **Immediate**: Ran `rollback_rls_policies.sql` to restore original working policies
- **Result**: Service restored, all endpoints functional
- **Time to Resolution**: < 5 minutes

## Lessons Learned
1. **Test RLS changes in development first**: Performance optimizations should be validated in non-production
2. **Supabase-specific syntax**: Generic PostgreSQL optimizations may not work in Supabase's managed environment
3. **Have rollback ready**: Always prepare rollback scripts before applying RLS changes
4. **Monitor after deployment**: Database-level changes can fail silently until queries are executed

## Alternative Approaches
For future performance optimization:
1. **Database indexing**: Add indexes on frequently queried columns
2. **Query optimization**: Optimize application-level queries instead of RLS
3. **Connection pooling**: Implement proper connection pooling for better performance
4. **Caching layer**: Add Redis or similar caching for frequently accessed data

## Status
- **Current State**: Original RLS policies restored and working
- **Performance**: Acceptable for current user load
- **Future**: Performance optimization deferred until thorough testing possible
