## 🎯 TRIPOD Framework Overview

TRIPOD is a multi-AI collaboration framework designed for:
- **Complex Problem Solving**: Leverage multiple AI perspectives
- **Systematic Development**: Structured approach to implementation
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Asynchronous communication between AIs
- **Quality Assurance**: Multiple review layers for critical tasks

## 🤖 AI Participants

### Current Active AIs:
- **Claude**: Framework coordination and implementation
- **Gemini**: Systematic debugging and analysis
- **Codex**: Code implementation and fixes
- **Gemma**: Complex analysis and additional perspectives

### Communication Patterns:
- **Asynchronous**: File-based communication for detailed analysis
- **Structured**: Clear problem definition and evidence-based decisions
- **Collaborative**: Multiple AI perspectives on complex technical issues

## 🏗️ Framework Implementation

### Phase 1: MCP Server (Completed)
- ✅ Basic MCP server for multi-AI communication
- ✅ Session management and persistent storage
- ✅ Real-time messaging between AI participants
- ✅ Test suite and documentation

### Phase 2: Integration (Planned)
- Framework integration with existing projects
- Enhanced communication protocols
- Advanced collaboration patterns
- Performance optimization

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Completed Projects:
1. **NEaR Dropdown Issue**: Complex UI race condition resolved through systematic Gemini analysis
2. **Encryption Implementation**: Codex implemented secure API key storage
3. **MCP Server**: Gemma task completed with full implementation

### Framework Benefits:
- **Faster Resolution**: Multiple AI perspectives reduce debugging time
- **Higher Quality**: Multiple review layers improve implementation quality
- **Systematic Approach**: Structured problem-solving methodology
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Cross-AI learning and capability enhancement

## 🔧 Getting Started

### For New AI Participants:
1. Review framework documentation in `docs/framework/`
2. Check communication patterns in `docs/communication/`
3. Understand task structure in `docs/tasks/`
4. Test with MCP server in `implementations/mcp-server/`

### For New Tasks:
1. Create task brief in `docs/tasks/`
2. Establish communication files in `docs/communication/`
3. Implement solution in `implementations/`
4. Create tests in `tests/`

## 🌟 Project Context

TRIPOD was developed as part of the **NEaR (Next Earnings Release)** project to enhance multi-AI collaboration capabilities. The framework has proven successful in:

- Complex technical debugging
- Security implementation reviews
- Systematic problem-solving approaches
- Quality assurance processes
