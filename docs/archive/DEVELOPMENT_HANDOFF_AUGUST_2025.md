## Next Phase Priorities

### Immediate Deployment (Week 1)
1. **Merge to Production**: Deploy enhanced transcription and infrastructure
2. **Database Migration**: Apply template system schema to production
3. **Validation Testing**: Ensure all existing features remain stable
4. **Production Monitoring**: Verify performance and error rates

### MVP Template Management (Week 2-3)
1. **Template Library UI**: Basic CRUD operations for templates
2. **Industry Organization**: Display and manage industry categories
3. **Simple Builders**: Text-based placeholder configuration
4. **Demo Preparation**: Polish for investor presentations

1. **Visual Builders**: Drag-and-drop placeholder configuration
2. **Template Analytics**: Usage tracking and performance metrics
3. **Enterprise Features**: Advanced admin controls and reporting
4. **Integration APIs**: External system connectivity

## Agent-Assisted Development Strategy

### Recommended Agent Usage
When resources become available, deploy specialized agents for:

1. **Frontend UI Development Agent**
   - Focus: React components, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
   - Tasks: Template Library UI, visual builders, responsive design
   - Context: CRT theme, enterprise UX patterns

2. **Database & Backend Agent**
   - Focus: PostgreSQL, Supabase, API development
   - Tasks: Migration deployment, performance optimization, RLS policies
   - Context: Multi-tenant architecture, security requirements

3. **Testing & QA Agent**
   - Focus: Jest, Playwright, integration testing
   - Tasks: Comprehensive test coverage, performance testing, security audits
   - Context: >80% coverage requirement, enterprise quality standards

4. **Documentation & Demo Agent**
   - Focus: Technical writing, demo preparation, investor materials
   - Tasks: API documentation, user guides, presentation materials
   - Context: Funding readiness, enterprise customer needs

### Parallel Development Approach
With multiple agents, work can proceed in parallel:
- **Frontend Agent**: Build Template Library UI components
- **Backend Agent**: Deploy database migration and optimize performance
- **Testing Agent**: Create comprehensive test suites
- **Demo Agent**: Prepare investor presentation materials

## Critical Success Factors

### Technical Requirements
- Maintain <100ms API response times
- Ensure >99.9% uptime during deployment
- Preserve all existing user data and functionality
- Complete comprehensive testing before production deployment

### Business Requirements
- Template system must demonstrate clear business value
- Visual builders must be intuitive for non-technical users
- Enterprise security and compliance features maintained
- Demo flows must work reliably for investor presentations

### Risk Mitigation
- **Deployment Risk**: Test thoroughly in staging before production
- **Data Risk**: Backup database before migration, plan rollback procedures
- **Feature Risk**: Build MVPs first, iterate based on feedback
- **Timeline Risk**: Focus on core functionality over advanced features

## Resource Scaling Plan

### When Resources Return
1. **Deploy Multiple Agents**: Frontend, Backend, Testing, Documentation
2. **Parallel Development**: Multiple work streams simultaneously
3. **Accelerated Timeline**: Target 2-3 week completion vs 6-8 weeks
4. **Enhanced Quality**: More thorough testing and optimization

### Success Metrics
- **Technical**: All tests passing, performance benchmarks met
- **Business**: Working demos, clear value proposition
- **Funding**: Professional presentation materials ready
- **Enterprise**: Security and compliance features validated

## Institutional Knowledge Preserved

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Deepgram over Whisper**: Performance and mobile optimization
- **Template Inheritance**: Global â†’ Industry â†’ Company hierarchy
- **Visual Configuration**: Business user accessibility priority
- **RLS Security**: Database-level multi-tenancy for enterprise

### Development Patterns
- **CRT Theme**: Unique brand differentiation with dark/green aesthetic
- **TypeScript Strict**: Complete type safety requirement
- **Security First**: RLS policies and input validation priority
- **Performance Focus**: Sub-second response time targets

### Business Strategy
- **Enterprise Focus**: Visual tools for non-technical administrators
- **Template Reusability**: Key selling point for organizational efficiency
- **Real-time Processing**: Competitive advantage in live earnings analysis
- **Industry Specialization**: Differentiation from generic AI tools
