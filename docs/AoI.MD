# Areas of Improvement & Action Plan

This document outlines three key areas for improving the `nexter` project, with a detailed action plan for our next session.

## 1. API Documentation

**Goal:** To create comprehensive, auto-generating API documentation that is easy to maintain and provides clear guidance for developers.

**Plan:**

1.  **Choose a Tool:** We will use a combination of JSDoc and a tool that can generate an OpenAPI (Swagger) specification from our code comments. This will allow us to keep the documentation close to the code, making it easier to maintain.

2.  **Annotate API Routes:** We will go through each API endpoint in the `app/api` directory and add detailed JSDoc comments. These comments will describe the endpoint's purpose, request and response payloads, status codes, and authentication requirements.

3.  **Generate Documentation:** We will set up a script to automatically generate an `openapi.json` file from the JSDoc comments. This script will be added to our `package.json` so that we can easily update the documentation whenever we make changes to the API.

4.  **Display Documentation:** We will add a new page to the application to display the generated API documentation in a user-friendly format using a tool like Swagger UI.

## 2. Architectural Diagram

**Goal:** To create a high-level architectural diagram that provides a visual overview of the system's components and their interactions.

**Plan:**

1.  **Choose a Tool:** We will use Mermaid, a lightweight, text-based tool for creating diagrams. This will allow us to embed the diagram directly into our `README.md` file and version control it with our code.

2.  **Design the Diagram:** The diagram will illustrate the following components:
    *   **Frontend:** The Next.js/React application running in the user's browser.
    *   **Backend:** The Next.js API routes running on the server.
    *   **Database:** The Supabase (PostgreSQL) database.
    *   **Authentication:** The Supabase Auth service.
    *   **External Services:** The various LLM provider APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).

3.  **Create the Diagram:** We will write the Mermaid syntax to create the diagram and embed it in the `README.md` file.

## 3. Contribution Guidelines

**Goal:** To create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file that provides clear and detailed instructions for developers who want to contribute to the project.

**Plan:**

1.  **Create the `CONTRIBUTING.md` File:** We will create a new file named `CONTRIBUTING.md` in the root of the project.

2.  **Write the Guidelines:** The file will include the following sections:
    *   **Getting Started:** How to clone the repository, install dependencies, and set up the development environment.
    *   **Development Workflow:** The process for creating a new feature or fixing a bug, including how to create a new branch, write code, and run tests.
    *   **Coding Standards:** The coding style and conventions that should be followed, including any linting or formatting rules.
    *   **Pull Request Process:** The steps for submitting a pull request, including how to write a good pull request description and what to expect from the review process.
    *   **Code of Conduct:** A link to the project's code of conduct.

By the end of our next session, we will have made significant progress in these three areas, making the `nexter` project more accessible and easier to contribute to for all developers.
