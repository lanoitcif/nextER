# Branch Cleanup Summary - August 6, 2025

## Current Branch Status

### Local Branches
- `main` - ✅ Active, up-to-date with origin/main

### Remote Branches
- `origin/main` - ✅ Primary branch, all work merged
- `origin/refactor-rls-policies` - 🗑️ Safe to delete (work merged)

## Branch Analysis

### `origin/refactor-rls-policies` (Jules' RLS Refactoring)
**Status**: Ready for deletion
**Created by**: Jules
**Purpose**: RLS performance improvements

**What was merged to main**:
- ✅ `migrations/20250806_refactor_rls_policies.sql` - Core migration
- ✅ `__tests__/sql/test_rls_policies.sql` - Test suite

**What wasn't merged** (intentionally):
- `backup/rls_policies_backup_20250806.sql` - We created our own backups
