## ‚ùì **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **For End Users**

#### **Getting Started**
**Q: How do I get access to the transcript analyzer?**
A: Your administrator will provide you with the web URL. Simply visit the link and create an account with your work email.

**Q: Do I need to install anything on my computer?**
A: No! This is a web application that runs entirely in your browser. Just visit the URL and sign in.

**Q: What kind of files can I upload?**
A: You can upload .txt or .md files, or simply paste your transcript text directly into the interface.

#### **API Keys & Costs**
**Q: Do I need my own API keys?**
A: This depends on your organization's setup. Some users may have access to organization-provided keys, while others may need to use their own. Check with your administrator.

**Q: How much do API calls cost?**
A: Costs vary by provider and usage. The system tracks estimated costs for you:
- OpenAI GPT-4o-mini: ~$0.15 per 1K tokens
- Anthropic Claude-3.5-sonnet: ~$3.00 per 1K tokens
- Actual costs depend on transcript length and complexity

**Q: Can I use multiple LLM providers?**
A: Yes! You can add API keys for different providers and choose which one to use for each analysis.

#### **Usage & Features**
**Q: What types of analysis are available?**
A: Currently four analysis types:
- Meeting Summary (key points, action items, decisions)
- Interview Analysis (themes, insights, recommendations)  
- Sentiment Analysis (emotional tone, participant dynamics)
- Sales Call Analysis (customer needs, objections, opportunities)

**Q: How long can my transcripts be?**
A: This depends on the LLM provider's limits. Most handle 10,000-100,000+ characters. Very long transcripts may be truncated.

**Q: Can I download my analysis results?**
A: Yes, you can copy results to clipboard or download as text files.

### **For Administrators**

#### **User Management**
**Q: How do I give users access to organization API keys?**
A: In your Supabase dashboard, go to Table Editor ‚Üí user_profiles and set `can_use_owner_key = true` for specific users.

**Q: How do I monitor usage and costs?**
A: Check the `usage_logs` table in Supabase for detailed usage statistics, token counts, and cost estimates.

**Q: Can I add custom analysis prompts?**
A: Yes, insert new prompts into the `prompts` table with custom system prompts and descriptions.

#### **Technical Setup**
**Q: How do I deploy this for my team?**
A: Deploy the Next.js application to Vercel/Netlify, configure environment variables with your API keys, and share the URL with your team.

**Q: What's the cost structure?**
A: Hosting costs are minimal (Vercel/Netlify free tiers). Main costs are LLM API usage, which you control through your API keys.

**Q: Is this secure for confidential transcripts?**
A: Yes - all user API keys are encrypted, sessions are secure, and transcripts are only sent to LLM providers during analysis (not stored permanently).

### **Technical Questions**

#### **Troubleshooting**
**Q: I'm getting "Invalid API key" errors**
A: Check that your API key is correct and has sufficient credits. API keys should not have extra spaces or characters.

**Q: The analysis is taking too long**
A: Large transcripts may take 30-60 seconds to process. If it times out, try breaking your transcript into smaller sections.

**Q: I can't see the owner key option**
A: Contact your administrator to enable owner key access for your account.

#### **Data & Privacy**
**Q: Where is my data stored?**
A: User accounts and encrypted API keys are stored in Supabase (PostgreSQL). Transcripts are processed in memory and not permanently stored.

**Q: Who can see my transcripts?**
A: Only you can see your transcripts. They're sent to your chosen LLM provider for analysis but not stored by our application.

**Q: Can I delete my data?**
A: Yes, you can delete your saved API keys anytime. Contact your administrator to delete your entire account.
