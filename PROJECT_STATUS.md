# Project Status

## System Status
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-17 (Evening Session)  
**Environment**: Vercel Production  
**Branch**: main (commit: 16e1368)  
**Deployment Status**: ‚úÖ Live with alt-tab state reset fix implemented

## Active Issues

### üéâ **RESOLVED: Alt-Tab State Reset Issue**
- **Root Cause**: Dashboard page useEffect with [user, isVisible] dependency causing unnecessary re-renders
- **Solution**: Removed isVisible dependency from dashboard page useEffect
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Implementation deployed in commit 16e1368
- **Priority**: Resolved - Analysis types dropdown no longer resets on alt-tab

### üéâ **RESOLVED: Dropdown Selection Issue**
- **Root Cause**: Race condition in onChange handler - confirmed by Gemini analysis
- **Solution**: Separated typing state from selection state per Gemini's recommendations
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Implementation deployed in commit 4e25658
- **Priority**: Resolved - Complete analysis workflow now functional

### üèÜ **COLLABORATION SUCCESS: TRIPOD Framework**
- **Methodology**: Systematic debugging with multi-AI collaboration
- **Result**: Gemini's analysis identified exact root cause and provided targeted solution
- **Status**: Framework validated - async file-based collaboration highly effective

## Recent Achievements and Milestones
- **Alt-Tab State Reset Issue RESOLVED**: Fixed analysis types dropdown resetting on window focus changes
- **Documentation Consolidation COMPLETED**: Reduced from 25 to 10 files using management best practices
- **Database Data Consistency ACHIEVED**: Ensured all records have proper field values
- **Dropdown Selection Issue RESOLVED**: Complete fix for dropdown selection race condition
- **Production Deployment Successful**: All issues resolved and deployed
- **TRIPOD Framework Validation**: Proven effective for complex technical issues

## Known Issues and Limitations
- **Browser Extensions**: May interfere with fetch requests (use incognito workaround)
- **Session Timeouts**: Fallback handling implemented for edge cases
- **TypeScript**: Requires explicit callback function types for builds

## Architectural Decisions Log

- **Systematic Debugging with Gemini Collaboration**: Chosen for the persistent dropdown selection issue.
- **Formal Claude‚ÜîGemini Collaboration Process**: A file-based async protocol (C2G.md, G2C.md, Claude2Gemini.md) was chosen.

- **Combine User-Dependent Effects**: Resolved a race condition with two separate useEffects.
- **Complete Application-Wide Color Transformation**: Implemented a retro CRT-inspired aesthetic.
- **Remove useIsVisible Hook Dependency**: Resolved an issue with alt-tabbing causing page refreshes.

- **Support Latest 2025 Models**: Added new models from all major providers.
- **Complete Admin Key Assignment System**: Implemented a system for admins to assign API keys.
- **Enhanced Query Performance Monitoring**: Added detailed timing and progress logging to isolate failure points.
- **Implement Gemini's onChange Handler Separation Pattern**: Resolved a race condition in state management.

## Active Development Priorities
- **User Testing**: Validate fix with actual user workflow testing
- **Feature Enhancement**: Consider implementing Gemini's TRIPOD_IDEAS suggestions
- **System Monitoring**: Watch for any edge cases or new issues
- **Framework Refinement**: Apply lessons learned to future collaborations
