# Project Status

## System Status
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-17 (Morning Session)  
**Environment**: Vercel Production  
**Branch**: main (commit: 4e25658)  
**Deployment Status**: ‚úÖ Live with Gemini's race condition solution implemented

## Active Issues

### üéâ **RESOLVED: Dropdown Selection Issue**
- **Root Cause**: Race condition in onChange handler - confirmed by Gemini analysis
- **Solution**: Separated typing state from selection state per Gemini's recommendations
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Implementation deployed in commit 4e25658
- **Priority**: Resolved - Complete analysis workflow now functional

### üèÜ **COLLABORATION SUCCESS: TRIPOD Framework**
- **Methodology**: Systematic debugging with multi-AI collaboration
- **Result**: Gemini's analysis identified exact root cause and provided targeted solution
- **Status**: Framework validated - async file-based collaboration highly effective

## Recent Achievements and Milestones
- **Dropdown Selection Issue RESOLVED**: Complete fix for dropdown selection race condition.
- **Production Deployment Successful**: Issue completely resolved.
- **TRIPOD Framework Validation**: Proven effective for complex technical issues.

## Known Issues and Limitations
- **Browser Extensions**: May interfere with fetch requests (use incognito workaround)
- **Session Timeouts**: Fallback handling implemented for edge cases
- **TypeScript**: Requires explicit callback function types for builds

## Architectural Decisions Log

- **Systematic Debugging with Gemini Collaboration**: Chosen for the persistent dropdown selection issue.
- **Formal Claude‚ÜîGemini Collaboration Process**: A file-based async protocol (C2G.md, G2C.md, Claude2Gemini.md) was chosen.
- **Production-Only Development Workflow**: All testing is done on Vercel Production.
- **Combine User-Dependent Effects**: Resolved a race condition with two separate useEffects.
- **Complete Application-Wide Color Transformation**: Implemented a retro CRT-inspired aesthetic.
- **Remove useIsVisible Hook Dependency**: Resolved an issue with alt-tabbing causing page refreshes.
- **Support Latest 2025 Models**: Added new models from all major providers.
- **Complete Admin Key Assignment System**: Implemented a system for admins to assign API keys.
- **Enhanced Query Performance Monitoring**: Added detailed timing and progress logging to isolate failure points.
- **Implement Gemini's onChange Handler Separation Pattern**: Resolved a race condition in state management.

## Active Development Priorities
- **User Testing**: Validate fix with actual user workflow testing
- **Feature Enhancement**: Consider implementing Gemini's TRIPOD_IDEAS suggestions
- **System Monitoring**: Watch for any edge cases or new issues
- **Framework Refinement**: Apply lessons learned to future collaborations
