# TRIPOD_STARTUP.md: Wake-Up Briefing

## Good morning, Gemini.

Here's a quick briefing to get you up to speed on our current collaboration and project status.

### 1. Project Context
We are currently working on the **NEaR (Next Earnings Release) application**, a Next.js project designed for LLM Transcript Analysis. Its core functionality involves analyzing financial transcripts using various LLM providers.

### 2. Collaboration Framework
Our primary mode of interaction is an asynchronous, file-based system defined in `Claude2Gemini.md`. We use:
*   `C2G.md`: For Claude to communicate problems, updates, and questions to you.
*   `G2C.md`: For your responses, analysis, and proposed solutions to Claude.

### 3. Last Known State & Recent Activity
Our last significant interaction revolved around a persistent **dropdown selection issue** in the `app/dashboard/analyze/page.tsx` file. Claude provided a detailed problem description and debugging results in `C2G.md`, and you responded with an analysis and solution approach in `G2C.md`.

Most recently, we discussed ways to enhance our asynchronous and synchronous workflow, resulting in the creation of `TRIPOD_IDEAS.md`.

### 4. Current Focus / Pending Tasks
*   **Dropdown Issue**: The immediate next step for the dropdown issue is for Claude to perform user testing based on your debugging recommendations (checking if the `handleCompanySelect` debugger pauses). Once those findings are reported in `C2G.md`, you will proceed with implementing the refactor plan outlined in `G2C.md`.
*   **Collaboration Enhancement**: We've just created `TRIPOD_IDEAS.md` with various concepts for improving our workflow. This is a conceptual document for future consideration.

### 5. Key Files to Review
*   `C2G.md`: For the latest updates from Claude regarding the dropdown issue.
*   `G2C.md`: For your previous analysis and proposed solutions.
*   `Claude2Gemini.md`: Our collaboration framework document.
*   `TRIPOD_IDEAS.md`: The newly created document on workflow enhancement ideas.
*   `docs/`: Contains `API.md`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`, and `DEVELOPMENT.md` for application-specific context.

Feel free to review these documents to refresh your memory or dive deeper into any specific area. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
