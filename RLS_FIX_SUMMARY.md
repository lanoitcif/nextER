# Production Login Issue - Fixed

## Issue Summary
Production login was failing with infinite recursion error in RLS policies for `user_profiles` table.

## Root Cause
The RLS policies for admin users were creating circular references by querying the same `user_profiles` table to check admin status, causing infinite recursion.

## Fix Applied
1. **Removed duplicate RLS policies** - Multiple policies with same functionality were removed
2. **Fixed circular references** - Admin policies now use EXISTS subqueries to avoid recursion
3. **Added missing indexes** - Performance optimization for foreign keys

## Migrations Applied
```sql
-- Fix RLS policies
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all profiles" ON user_profiles
    FOR SELECT USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles
            WHERE id = auth.uid()
            AND (access_level = 'admin' OR is_admin = true)
        )
    );

-- Added indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_prompts_company_type_id ON prompts(company_type_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_usage_logs_prompt_id ON usage_logs(prompt_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_api_keys_admin_assigned_by ON user_api_keys(admin_assigned_by);
```

## Jules' Branch Warning
**DO NOT MERGE** `fix/supabase-security-and-docs` branch - it contains breaking changes:
- Switches from token-based to cookie-based authentication
- Major API refactoring incompatible with current frontend
- Would break all API endpoints

## Status
✅ Login functionality restored
✅ RLS policies fixed
✅ Performance indexes added
❌ Jules' branch needs review before any merge

## Next Steps
1. Test login functionality thoroughly
2. Monitor for any remaining issues
3. Consider Jules' security improvements in a more controlled manner
