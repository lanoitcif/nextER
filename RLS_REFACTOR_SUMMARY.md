# RLS Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Jules has completed a comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) policy refactoring to eliminate circular dependencies and improve query performance.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Private Schema with Cached Functions
- Created `private` schema for security helper functions
- Implemented transaction-level caching to avoid repeated lookups
- Functions: `private.is_admin()` and `private.get_user_access_level()`

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- Eliminated circular dependencies between tables
- Cached security checks reduce database queries
- Used `SECURITY DEFINER` for privileged operations
- Marked functions as `STABLE` for query optimization

### 3. Test Suite
- Created comprehensive SQL test suite
- Tests both regular user and admin scenarios
- Verifies all RLS policies work correctly
- Includes cleanup for test data

## Migration Details

**File**: `migrations/20250806_refactor_rls_policies.sql`
- Version: 2.0.0
- Date: August 6, 2025
- Safe to apply with transaction rollback support

## Testing Instructions

1. Apply the migration:
```sql
psql [connection_string] -f migrations/20250806_refactor_rls_policies.sql
```

2. Run the test suite:
```sql
psql [connection_string] --single-transaction -f __tests__/sql/test_rls_policies.sql
```

## Expected Benefits

1. **Performance**: Significantly faster queries due to cached security checks
2. **Reliability**: No more circular dependency errors
3. **Maintainability**: Centralized security logic in private schema
4. **Testability**: Comprehensive test coverage for RLS policies

## Next Steps

1. Apply migration to development database
2. Run test suite to verify
3. Monitor query performance improvements
4. Deploy to production after verification

## Notes
- This refactoring maintains all existing security guarantees
- Backwards compatible with current application code
- No application code changes required
