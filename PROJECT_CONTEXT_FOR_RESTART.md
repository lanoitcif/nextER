# NextER Project Context for Development Restart

**Created**: August 2, 2025  
**Purpose**: Immediate context for resuming development with enhanced resources

## Quick Start Summary

### What NextER Is
- **SaaS Platform**: AI-powered earnings call transcript analysis
- **Key Differentiation**: Visual AI configuration for non-technical business users
- **Target Market**: Financial analysts, investment banks, research firms
- **Production URL**: https://lanoitcif.com

### Current State (Ready to Scale)

- **[FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)** - Development roadmap

### Database & Code
- **`/migrations/20250802_enhanced_template_system.sql`** - Template system migration
- **`/app/dashboard/transcribe/page.tsx`** - New transcription UI
- **`/app/api/live-transcription/deepgram-stream/route.ts`** - Enhanced API

## Technical Environment

### Production (main branch)
- **Status**: Stable, working core functionality
- **Database**: Original schema with existing user data
- **Features**: Analysis pipeline, company management, basic transcription

### Development (feature/deepgram-and-prompt-ui branch)
- **Status**: Ready for deployment
- **New Features**: Enhanced transcription UI, template system foundation
- **Database**: Migration ready for template inheritance system

### Next Deployment Strategy
1. Test feature branch thoroughly
2. Apply database migration to production
3. Merge enhanced features to main
4. Validate all existing functionality preserved

## Agent Development Plan

### Recommended Agent Specialization
1. **Frontend UI Agent**: Template Library, visual builders, React components
2. **Backend Database Agent**: Migration deployment, API optimization, RLS policies  
3. **Testing QA Agent**: Comprehensive test coverage, performance validation
4. **Documentation Demo Agent**: Investor materials, user guides, API docs

### Parallel Work Streams
- **Week 1**: Database migration + Template Library UI foundation
- **Week 2**: Visual builders + comprehensive testing + demo polish
- **Week 3**: Integration testing + investor presentation prep

## Business Context

### Value Proposition
- **10x faster** earnings analysis vs manual methods
- **Visual configuration** eliminates technical barriers for business users
- **Real-time processing** during live earnings calls
- **Enterprise scalability** with template inheritance and RLS security

### Market Opportunity
- **TAM**: $8.2B financial analytics software market
- **Target**: 2,500 financial firms globally, $50K-$200K annual contracts
- **Positioning**: Complementary to Bloomberg/FactSet, not competitive

### Funding Status
- **Documentation**: Professional materials ready
- **Demo**: 10-minute walkthrough prepared
- **Technical**: Enterprise-grade architecture validated
- **Market**: Clear competitive differentiation established

## Memory MCP Knowledge

All institutional knowledge captured including:
- **Repository cleanup process** and backup strategy
- **Deepgram implementation details** and performance optimization
- **Template system architecture** with inheritance hierarchy
- **Development workflow standards** and quality requirements
- **Business strategy** and enterprise selling points
- **Architectural decisions** and technical rationale

## Success Criteria for Restart

### Technical Validation ✅
- Feature branch deploys without breaking existing functionality
- Database migration applies cleanly with proper RLS policies
- Enhanced transcription works reliably in production
- All tests pass with improved coverage

### Business Validation ✅
- Template Library UI demonstrates clear business value
- Visual builders show non-technical user accessibility
- Demo flows work smoothly for investor presentations
- Enterprise features satisfy security and compliance requirements

## Ready for Immediate Action

The project is positioned for accelerated development with enhanced resources:
- **Clean Architecture**: Well-organized, documented codebase
- **Clear Priorities**: Specific next steps with business justification
- **Professional Presentation**: Funding-ready documentation and demos
- **Scalable Foundation**: Database and infrastructure ready for growth

**Next Command**: Deploy specialized agents and continue Template Library UI development while applying production database migration.

This context enables immediate productive work across multiple parallel development streams without requiring additional research or planning phases.
